This is an application example using ST Nucleo F103 board.

SB62 and SB63 should be soldered.
ST-Link/V2 is disconnected (SB13 and SB14).

NOTE:

Using the USB CDC-ACM for serial communication is a kind of wrong,
because it's designed for modem;  No way to control CTSRTS.

TODO:
* Use of DMA for serial communication
* RS-232 support: GPIO with DTR (out), DCD (in), DSR (in), RI (in)
* serial config setting of CTSRTS?
  By vendor specific control?
* stats report control
  By vendor specific control?
* Half-duplex support
* Support of other communication mode: smartcard, IrDA, etc.
